## GOV.UK Prototype Kit 

You'll need the prototype kit for creating interactive prototypes for user research (UR). We've pulled together some resources to help get you started with using the kit:

## ["One thing per page" is a myth] (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page)

Or, at least, a misquote. The actual advice is "START with one thing per page". 

Also part of the same advice: "User research will tell you when you can merge pages together. For example, if you’re designing an internal service for government users who need to repeat and switch between tasks quickly." 

So, put as much on a page as is sensible for the context, and that is beneficial for the user.
